# RNN

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network which uses sequential data or time series data.

RNN is a type of Neural Network where the output from the previous step is fed as input to the current step. In traditional neural networks, all the inputs and outputs are independent of each other, but in cases when it is required to predict the next word of a sentence, the previous words are required and hence there is a need to remember the previous words.
